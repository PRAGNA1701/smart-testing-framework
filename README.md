Overview

The Smart Testing Framework is an independently developed Selenium-based automation framework for testing web applications. It is built using Java, TestNG, and Maven, and demonstrates skills in test automation, code design, and project organization.

Key Features

  1. Cross-Browser Testing: Uses Selenium WebDriver and WebDriverManager to manage browser drivers automatically.

  2. TestNG Integration: Runs structured tests and generates reports with TestNG.

  3. Page Object Model (POM): Organizes code for easy maintenance and reuse.

  4. Maven Project Structure: Handles dependencies and build processes with Maven.

  5. Logging: Uses SLF4J and Logback for clear logging of test execution.

Technologies Used

  1. Java 17

  2. Selenium WebDriver

  3. TestNG

  4. Maven

  5. SLF4J / Logback
