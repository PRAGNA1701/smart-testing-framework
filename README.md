Smart Testing Framework
Overview

The Smart Testing Framework is an independently developed Selenium-based automation framework for testing web applications. It is built using Java, TestNG, and Maven, and demonstrates skills in test automation, code design, and project organization.

Key Features

Cross-Browser Testing: Uses Selenium WebDriver and WebDriverManager to manage browser drivers automatically.

TestNG Integration: Runs structured tests and generates reports with TestNG.

Page Object Model (POM): Organizes code for easy maintenance and reuse.

Maven Project Structure: Handles dependencies and build processes with Maven.

Logging: Uses SLF4J and Logback for clear logging of test execution.

If you want, I can also draft a short “O-1A submission note” that describes your independent contribution and technical achievement, which you can attach with this GitHub repo for your visa application.

Do you want me to do that next?
