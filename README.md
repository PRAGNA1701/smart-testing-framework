# Smart Testing Framework

## Overview

The Smart Testing Framework is an independently developed **Selenium-based automation framework** for testing web applications. It is built using **Java, TestNG, and Maven**, and demonstrates skills in test automation, code design, and project organization. This work showcases independent technical skills suitable for O-1A visa criteria.

## Key Features

1. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Uses Selenium WebDriver and WebDriverManager to manage browser drivers automatically.  
2. **TestNG Integration:** Runs structured tests and generates detailed reports with TestNG.  
3. **Page Object Model (POM):** Organizes code for easy maintenance and reuse.  
4. **Maven Project Structure:** Handles dependencies and build processes with Maven.  
5. **Logging:** Uses SLF4J and Logback for clear logging of test execution.  

## Technologies Used

- Java 17  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- TestNG  
- Maven  
- SLF4J / Logback  
- WebDriverManager  

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone git@github.com:PRAGNA1701/smart-testing-framework.git
cd smart-testing-framework

2. **Build and run tests using Maven:**

mvn clean test


3. **Test results and logs will be available in the target folder after execution.**

## Usage

This framework is an example of independently developed technical work in automated testing. It can serve as a foundation for testing any web application and can be extended for larger-scale automation projects. It demonstrates cross-browser and functional testing capabilities, highlighting independent technical skills.
